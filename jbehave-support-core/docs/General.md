## Escaping special characters

Characters ':', '{' and '}' are treated as special characters they are used to mark an expression command or delimit parameters for an expression command.
When JBehave-support tries to parse the string {x:y} as an expression command it will return an error.
If you need use such a string you have to use '\' as an escape character. The string above should be typed as \{x\:y\}.
The behaviour is documented in [ExpressionEvaluatorTest](../src/test/groovy/org/jbehavesupport/core/expression/ExpressionEvaluatorTest.groovy)
and in [EscapingInContext story](../src/test/groovy/org/jbehavesupport/test/sample/EscapingInContext.story).

## Verification

### Comparison operators

For some verification steps it's possible to use verifiers such as:
`EQ` - equals - default when no operator is specified
`NE` - not equals
`LT` - lower than
`GT` - greater than
`CONTAINS` - String contains another String
`NOT_CONTAINS` - String doesn't contain another String
`SIZE_EQ` - Size of collection is exactly expected value
`SIZE_LT` - Size of collection is lower than expected value
`SIZE_GT` - Size of collection is greater than expected value
`REGEX_MATCH` - Matches String using regular expression

The following sample step compares data from a ClientResponse from MYAPP against values in test context using operators.

```
Then [ClientResponse] values from [MYAPP] match:
| name        | verifier | expectedValue |
| client.cuid | NE       | {CP:CUID_1}   |
| client.cuid | NE       | {CP:CUID_2}   |
| client.cuid | NE       | {CP:CUID_3}   |
```
